E-Commerce
============

The pages are all linked and working, but are not very exciting. Feel
free to do your thing within the "main-content" areas of your respective
pages. We could use a favicon, images, and filler text for the templated
areas. The rest can be completed as a group on Thurs. We'll have to copy
and paste to each page for the header, footer, etc. once we finish it.
The CSS is bare, but you can see the id's and classes I put in the 
markup, we will need more for sure.
